# React-native setup
Please follow Facebooks guide for [getting started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

**!!IMPORTANT**
Developing React Native projects requires:
 - Java 1.7 or later (for android)
 - Git
 - npm v3
 - Node 4 or greater. (I use node 5.9.1 and it works)
 
 

## node
To manage node versions you can use [n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n)

## npm
If you already have installed npm v2, and want to run npm v3 alongside npm v2 you can install [npm3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm3).

## Android
Development for android devices requires the Android SDK, [download Android Studio or the Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).

As an alternative you can also use the Genymotion emulator (skip step 1 and 2).

In general the Genymotion emulator has better performance then the one provided by the Android SDK and it is easier to set up.
It does however integrate differently with the Android Device Bridge (ADB), and therefore requires some extra set up to get live-reloading.

The setup for windows was more tedious than on OSX, we therefore recommend using OSX if possible.
Notes we took from our troubleshooting during the setup-process on windows and OSX can be found here;

* [Windows](trouble-windows-android.md)
* [OSX](trouble-osx-android.md)

1. Ensure that you got the Android SDK installed and ANDROID_HOME pointing to the SDK.
2. Configure the SDK, download these packages with API-level 23 or higher;
    * Android SDK tools
    * Android SDK Platform-tools
    * Android SDK Build-tools
    * SDK Platform
    * Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image
    * Intel x86 Atom System Image
    * Local Maven repository for Support Libraries
3. Configure an emulator image (Tip: Set Back Camera to Webcam to be able to take pictures during the workshop)
4. Start the emulator
5. Clone the repository; `git clone git@github.com:bekk/react-native-workshop.git`
6. Run `npm install && npm install react-native-cli -g` to install dependencies

### Windows
1. Run `react-native start`
2. Run `react-native run-android` in another shell, if this fails try `cd android && ./gradlew installDebug`
3. Verify that the app is running in the emulator

If you have any trouble check [this](trouble-windows-android.md)

### OSX
1. Run `bash android/run.sh`, this checks your configuration and starts react-native
2. Verify that the app is running in the emulator

If you have any trouble check [this](trouble-osx-android.md)

## IOS
Devlopment for IOS devices requires XCode (>7.x.x) to be installed, find it in the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/no/app/xcode/id497799835).

1. Clone the repository; `git clone git@github.com:bekk/react-native-workshop.git`
2. Run `npm install && npm install react-native-cli -g` to install dependencies
3. Run `react-native run-ios`
4. Verify that the app is running in the simulator

If steps 3 returns an error, try starting XCode and start an emulator before"
